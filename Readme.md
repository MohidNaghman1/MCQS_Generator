# MCQ Generator App

This is a Flask web application that automatically generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT files).

The app extracts text from the uploaded file, generates MCQs using an AI model, and allows users to download the questions as `.txt` or `.pdf` files.

#  How It Works

Enter how many MCQs you want.

The app reads the file, sends the text to an AI model, and creates MCQs.

You can download the MCQs as .txt or .pdf!
